        <h2>Artificial Intelligence: An Overview</h2>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Artificial Intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is a fascinating field that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks may include problem-solving, learning, speech recognition, and decision-making.</p>
        
            <img class="blog-image" src="ai_image.jpg" alt="AI Concept" >

            <h3>History of AI</h3>
            <p>The concept of AI has been around for centuries, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that significant progress was made. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference, where the founders of the field envisioned creating machines that could simulate human intelligence.</p>

            <h3>Types of AI</h3>
            <p>AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks and is prevalent in various applications, such as virtual assistants like Siri and chatbots. On the other hand, General AI, or Strong AI, refers to machines with human-like cognitive abilities that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains.</p>

            <h3>Applications of AI</h3>
            <p>The applications of AI are diverse and continue to expand rapidly. AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. It is used in medical diagnosis, financial fraud detection, language translation, autonomous vehicles, and much more.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>As AI becomes more prevalent in our lives, it raises important ethical considerations. Issues such as data privacy, bias in algorithms, job displacement, and the impact on society need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible and ethical AI development and deployment.</p>

            <h3>The Future of AI</h3>
            <p>The future of AI is incredibly promising. As research and technology continue to advance, we can expect AI to play an even more significant role in shaping the world. However, it is essential to strike a balance between innovation and ensuring that AI benefits humanity as a whole.</p>
